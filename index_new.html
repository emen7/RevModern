            <h2>Project Notes</h2>
            <p>This demo version uses the Standard Reference Text to present the Urantia Book's Foreword and the first 15 papers. The text is unaltered, though some formatting is updated to present the content clearly and to help with understanding. Here you will find a modern theme that includes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Increased boldness of <em>italicized words</em> and words in <b>ALL CAPS.</b></li>
                <li>Proper alignment for the hundreds of numbered lists and tables interspersed throughout the papers.</li>
                <li>Sans-serif font for best legibility on devices.</li>
                <li>Hidden reference numbers.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
	<b>Historical Perspective</b>
	<p>As time passes, it becomes more difficult to learn why certain decisions were made that affected typesetting for the first printing of the Urantia Book. Evidently, a complete typewritten version was supplied to a Chicago printing company. This version probably had numbered lists in paragraph form. Numbered lists and other multicolumn data are hard to produce with a manual typewriter. When column data was not enumerated, rows of dots separated list elements.</p>
	
	<p>Today, most numbered lists show numbers under numbers and text under text. Back in the 1940s, list formatting must have been discussed with the publisher. The Urantia people were likely informed that arranging the lists into proper columns and rows could be done, but this would incur significant added expense. The tables would need to end correctly on each page that contained them. And this would involve actual typesetting using movable type, not the low-cost computer typesetting we can do today. Enhanced formatting may have increased the cost of the first printing by thirty percent or more. It's just speculation, but the added cost may have hindered a more desirable presentation.</p>
	<b>Emphasis</b>
	<p>It's been reported that words to be emphasized were underlined by the revelators. This underlining was probably continued in the version sent to the printer, since italics would not have been possible on typewriters of the day. Was emphasizing the italicized words further with bold type discussed? This Demo makes the italics bolder providing an overview the revelators may have intended. 
	</p>
	<b>Modern Theme</b>
	<p>This project supplies a vision for how the book may have been formatted if modern processes were available at the time of first publication. You may find that the proposed formatting will make the Urantia Book more readable and accessible for a wider, and maybe younger readership. The changes could make studying easier on devices like phones and tablets. Features like font type, size, and ref numbers can be set in user preferences as can all elements of this modern theme.</p>

	<br>
	<b>Paragraph Spacing within Paper Sections</b>
	<p>Another concept can be implemented in this updated theme. In the print version, sometimes extra space is given between paragraphs to indicate a change of direction without starting a new section. It might be helpful for digital versions to indicate this spacing with a faint line. </p>
	
<b>Default Fonts for Devices</b>
	<p>Studies suggest that sans-serif is more legible on devices like phones, and for electronic reading in general. 
		AI provided these sources for this evaluation:</p>
		<div class="grid-numlist">
		<p class="number">1. </p><p class="text">"Comparing the Legibility of Display and ClearType Fonts on LCD Screens" by Bonnie K. Stone and John F. S. Connolly (2006): This study compared the legibility of serif and sans-serif fonts on LCD screens and found that sans-serif fonts were more legible at smaller sizes.</p>
		
		<p class="number">2. </p><p class="text">"Web Font Legibility: Serif vs. Sans Serif" by Sagi Haviv (2013): This study tested the legibility of serif and sans-serif fonts on a variety of digital screens, including phones, and found that sans-serif fonts were generally more legible.</p>
		
		<p class="number">3. </p><p class="text">"Typographic Legibility on Mobile Devices" by Bichlien Nguyen and Wei Luo (2017): This study investigated the impact of font style, size, and line spacing on legibility on mobile devices and found that sans-serif fonts with larger font sizes and increased line spacing were the most legible.</p>
		</div>
		<p>"These studies provide strong evidence for the use of sans-serif fonts on phone screens. However, it's important to keep in mind that legibility can also be influenced by factors such as lighting conditions, screen resolution, and individual visual acuity, so it's always a good idea to test font choices with your specific audience."</p>
